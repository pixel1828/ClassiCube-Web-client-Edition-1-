classic-version-1 is NOT the main file, it is the extracted contents of https://classicube.net/server/play?warned=true. 
running this is simply just using classicube's own website code, and is NOT meant to be embedded. it stays on it's own. that is it's purpose.
INSTEAD, for the simple version of the web client, go to js/method1/ClassiCube.html.
A full version of classicube with my own textures in it can be found in catclimb.vercel.app.
